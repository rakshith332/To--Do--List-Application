## Learning Objectives

This project covers the following key concepts:

1. **DOM Manipulation**
   - Selecting and modifying DOM elements
   - Creating and appending new elements
   - Event handling (click events, form submission)

2. **CRUD Operations**
   - Create: Adding new tasks
   - Read: Displaying tasks and their states
   - Update: Editing tasks and marking as complete
   - Delete: Removing tasks from the list

3. **Local Storage**
   - Saving tasks to local storage
   - Retrieving tasks from local storage
   - Updating local storage when tasks change

## Future Enhancements

- Implement drag-and-drop for task reordering
- Add due dates and priority levels for tasks
- Create multiple lists or categories
- Implement user authentication for personalized lists
